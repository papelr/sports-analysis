## Libraries

library(plotly)

```

## Basic data scrape in chunk below, using rvest() package

You'll notice that it brings in a table that does not look great:

```{R - Predator Player Data}

# Pred player stat table through 1/24/19
stat_url <- 'https://www.naturalstattrick.com/playerteams.php?fromseason=20182019&thruseason=20182019&stype=2&sit=5v5&score=all&stdoi=oi&rate=n&team=NSH&pos=S&loc=B&toi=0&gpfilt=none&fd=&td=&tgp=410&lines=single'

# Reading in text
player_table <- stat_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_table(fill = T, header = T) 

# Print initial table
print(player_table)

```

## Some easy data cleaning below

I make that jumble of text into a data frame, remove some columns, and also do some text cleaning. The scrape replaced the percentage signs with periods, for whatever reason, and I sub those back in:   

```{R - Player Data Cleaning}

# Coercing table into data frame
player_df <- as.data.frame(player_table)

# Removing first column, just numbers players, so no need for it
player_df <- player_df[, -1]

# Select relevant columns
player_df <- player_df[, c(1:16)]

# Replace period in column names with % signs (scrape replaced them)
names(player_df) <- gsub(".", "%", names(player_df), fixed = T)

# Print data table
print(player_df)

```

## Sample statistic plot

Sample plot showing players and number of games played:

```{R pressure, echo = TRUE}

table1 <- player_df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(reorder(Player, GP), GP, fill = Position)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
      title = "Predator Player Data",
      subtitle = "Games Played through Jan 24",
      x = "Players",
      y = "Games Played",
      caption = "Sample by R. Papel") +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
      plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"),
      axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "grey70", size = 0.2),
      legend.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
      legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
      legend.background = element_rect(color = "grey70"), 
      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold", color = "black"),
      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold", color = "black")
    )

plotlytable <- ggplotly(table1)
plotlytable

```
